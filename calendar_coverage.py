Calendar coverage reconciler — did every scraped sale survive the merge?

THE CASCADE THIS CLOSES

The auction pipeline is a chain, and lots hang off the far end of it:

    house site -> scraper -> data/*_auctions.csv -> public/auctions.json
                                                          |
                                        auction_lots_scraper walks THIS
                                                          |
                                                    public/auction_lots.json

The lot enumerator only ever visits sales present in auctions.json, so a
sale lost at ANY earlier link takes its lots with it, silently. That is
how Phillips being absent from the calendar for six weeks also meant six
weeks with zero Phillips lots, without either fact surfacing on its own.

Each link now has a check, and this file is the one that was missing:

    site    -> scraper   calendar_canary.py          (live fetch returns 0?)
    scraper -> CSV       auction_calendar_health.py  (CSV absent/empty?)
    CSV     -> JSON      *** THIS FILE ***
    JSON    -> lots      auction_health.py           (catalog but no lots?)

IDENTITY: WHY NOT URL

The obvious key is the sale URL. It is wrong here, and quietly so:
Antiquorum points five different upcoming sales at one placeholder page
(their per-sale catalog URL is not published until days before), and
Sotheby's reuses slugs across sales. Matching on URL would let a genuinely
dropped sale hide behind a namesake and report all-clear.

So this reuses merge.auction_id(house, date_start, title) — the same
hash merge.py stamps into each sale as `id`. Reusing it rather than
inventing a parallel key means the reconciler cannot disagree with the
merge about what "the same sale" means, which is the only way a
reconciler is worth anything.

SCOPE

Only UPCOMING and LIVE sales are enforced. Past sales legitimately age
out, so demanding they persist would be permanent noise — and a past sale
has no lots left to miss.

Runs AFTER merge.py in the auctions workflow and touches no network: both
sides are artifacts of the run that just happened, so there is no
staleness window and no extra load on the houses.

Usage:
    python3 calendar_coverage.py           # exit 1 on any dropped sale
    python3 calendar_coverage.py --warn    # report only, always exit 0
